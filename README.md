================

## Styles that make Project Gutenberg's huge collection of books more readable. 

You can easily use a browser plugin to override the current styles, like Stylish:

- [For Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)
- [For Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/)


**11/22/2013:** First implementation includes simple style updates. This version is not responsive, though please, fork and improve.
